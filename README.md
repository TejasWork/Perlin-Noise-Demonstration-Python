# Perlin-Noise-Demonstration-Python
This code is made to explain how "Perlin Noise" works in a graphical way, it is fairly easy to understand.

You can open the setup.bat file on windows or install pyglet from pip and run main.py,
Click space to pause and start the simulation,
you can change the intensity of perlin noise, change color of the chart and a few other things.

This is a screenshot I took so you know its worth a try:
