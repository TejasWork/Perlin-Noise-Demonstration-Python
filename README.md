# Perlin Noise Demonstration In Python
This code is made to explain how "Perlin Noise" works in a graphical way, it is fairly easy to understand.

You can use up arrow key to increase the perlin intensity and down arrow to do the opposite,
left and right arrow keys are used to change the perlin density or may I just say density and use space bar to play and pause the simulation.

The chart continues infinitely.

This is the screenshot of the program:
